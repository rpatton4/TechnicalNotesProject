## Ternary Operator: ?
**Syntax:** `condition ? consequent : alternative`

**Notes:** Condition must evaluate to true or false. If true, the result of the consequent is returned.  If false, the 
result of the alternative is returned.

**Example:**
```
X > Y ? "X is greater than Y" : "X is less than or equal to Y"
```

## Lambda Expressions
**Syntax:** 
`<input parameters> => <expression>`  
or  
`<input parameters> => {<sequence of statements>}`

**Notes:**
Lambda expressions are used like anonymous functions, with the difference that in Lambda expressions you don't need to
specify the type of the value that you input thus making it more flexible to use.
